# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
User-interface is built on react framework.React js built a front end part, A platform that helps to store and retrieve the data stored on our decentralized network.
Here images are stored on pinata.Pinata is an IPFS pinning service that makes IPFS easy for creators. We helps to creators get their original content on IPFS through our easy-to-use web page app.Once it's uploaded through Pinata,It's automatically pinned to IPFS and gets uniue CID.
To store and access data on secure and distributed network we used IPFS network.It is a file storing system based on IPFS blockchain storage model.
Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software. It consists of different components for editing, compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, all of which work together to create a complete development environment.
To deploy the contract , We use a Hardhat script inside the scripts/ folder.
to run Hardhat network , so that external clients can connect to is through Metamask wallet. We run 'npx hardhat node'.
This will expose a JSON-RPC interface to Hardhat Network. To use it connect your wallet or application 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
